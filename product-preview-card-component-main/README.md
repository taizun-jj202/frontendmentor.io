## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first time trying out a mobile-first design approach. I was able to complete this on my third variation. The first version was desktop version only that did not scale well into mobile dimensions. The third time, it felt easy enough to do in one sitting.
